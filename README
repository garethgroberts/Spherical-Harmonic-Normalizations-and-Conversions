the files in this directory convert the spherical harmonic coefficients
from forte & rowley (2022), provided by a. forte, from their complex 
form with the condon-shortley phase, to real form without the condon-shortley 
phase. the resultant coefficients can then be inserted into s. ghelichkhan's 
propmat code (with an additional multiplicative sqrt(4pi) term), and
used in pyshtools. 

to run the code first look at 

./recast_forte_coeffs_to_shtool_coeffs.sh
